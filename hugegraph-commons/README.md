hugegraph-commons is a common module for [HugeGraph](https://github.com/apache/hugegraph) and its peripheral components.

numeric or collection util classes to simplify the development of HugeGraph and its components.

## Components

- Lock: atomic lock, key lock, lock group and lock manger
- Config: register and load config option with security check
- Event: listening and notification, do something asynchronously
- Iterator: some iterators with extra functions, map, filter, extend, etc.
- Rest: RESTful client implemented on OkHttp, POST, PUT, GET and DELETE
- Util: performance analyzer, version checker, numeric and Collection utils, log and exception utils, etc.
