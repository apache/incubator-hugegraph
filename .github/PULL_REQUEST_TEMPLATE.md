<!-- 
  Thank you very much for contributing to Apache HugeGraph, we are happy that you want to help us improve it!

  Here are some tips for you:
    1. If this is your first time, please read the [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/apache/hugegraph/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)

    2. If a PR fix/close an issue, type the message "close xxx" (xxx is the link of related 
issue) in the content, GitHub will auto link it (Required)

    3. Name the PR title in "Google Commit Format", start with "feat | fix | perf | refactor | doc | chore", 
      such like: "feat(core): support the PageRank algorithm" or "fix: wrong break in the compute loop" (module is optional)
      skip it if you are unsure about which is the best component.

    4. One PR address one issue, better not to mix up multiple issues.

    5. Put an `x` in the `[ ]` to mark the item as CHECKED. `[x]` (or click it directly after 
published)
