HugeGraph is a fast-speed and highly-scalable [graph database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_database). Billions of vertices and edges can be easily stored into and queried from HugeGraph due to its excellent OLTP ability. As compliance to [Apache TinkerPop 3](https://tinkerpop.apache.org/) framework, various complicated graph queries can be accomplished through [Gremlin](https://tinkerpop.apache.org/gremlin.html)(a powerful graph traversal language).

## Features

- Compliance to [Apache TinkerPop 3](https://tinkerpop.apache.org/), supporting [Gremlin](https://tinkerpop.apache.org/gremlin.html)
- Schema Metadata Management, including VertexLabel, EdgeLabel, PropertyKey and IndexLabel
- Multi-type Indexes, supporting exact query, range query and complex conditions combination query
- Plug-in Backend Store Driver Framework, supporting RocksDB, Cassandra, ScyllaDB, HBase and MySQL now and easy to add other backend store driver if needed
- Integration with Hadoop/Spark
