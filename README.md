[HugeGraph](https://hugegraph.apache.org/) is a fast-speed and highly-scalable [graph database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_database). 
Billions of vertices and edges can be easily stored into and queried from HugeGraph due to its excellent OLTP ability. As compliance to [Apache TinkerPop 3](https://tinkerpop.apache.org/) framework, various complicated graph queries can be accomplished through [Gremlin](https://tinkerpop.apache.org/gremlin.html)(a powerful graph traversal language).

## Features

- Compliance to [Apache TinkerPop 3](https://tinkerpop.apache.org/), support [Gremlin](https://tinkerpop.apache.org/gremlin.html) & [Cypher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cypher) language
- Schema Metadata Management, including VertexLabel, EdgeLabel, PropertyKey and IndexLabel
- Multi-type Indexes, supporting exact query, range query and complex conditions combination query
- Plug-in Backend Store Driver Framework, support `RocksDB`, `Cassandra`, `HBase`, `ScyllaDB`, and `MySQL/Postgre` now and easy to add other backend store driver if needed
- Integration with `Flink/Spark/HDFS`, and friendly to connect other big data platforms

## Quick Start

### 1. Docker Way

We can use `docker run -itd --name=graph -p 8080:8080 hugegraph/hugegraph` to quickly start an inner 
HugeGraph server with `RocksDB` in background.

Optional: use `docker exec -it graph bash` to enter the container to do some operations.

### 2. Download Way

Visit [Download Page](https://hugegraph.apache.org/docs/download/download/) and refer the [doc](https://hugegraph.apache.org/docs/quickstart/hugegraph-server/#33-source-code-compilation) 
to download the latest release package and start the server.

### 3. Source Building Way

Visit [Source Building Page](https://hugegraph.apache.org/docs/quickstart/hugegraph-server/#33-source-code-compilation) and follow the 
steps to build the source code and start the server.

The project [doc page](https://hugegraph.apache.org/docs/) contains more information on HugeGraph
and provides detailed documentation for users. (Structure / Usage / API / Configs...)
